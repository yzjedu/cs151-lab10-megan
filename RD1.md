### Reflection for Movie Profit Analysis Project

----------

**Objective:**  
The goal of this project was to practice working with files (reading and writing), functions, and lists of lists by analyzing movie data from a CSV file. I calculated profits for each movie, wrote the results to a new output file, and identified the movie with the highest or lowest profit based on user preference.

----------

**Procedure:**  
I began by thoroughly reading and understanding the project requirements and provided details. Then, I created my algorithms to guide me in solving the problem step by step. I used iterative development to implement the code, testing each function as it was completed. The primary concepts I focused on were file I/O, list manipulation, and error handling to ensure robust program behavior.

----------

**Results:**  
My final program worked as intended. The calculated profits for the movies were accurate, and the output file was generated correctly with the additional profit column. The program successfully identified the movies with the highest and lowest profits based on user input. I conducted several test cases, including edge cases with incomplete or incorrect data, to ensure the program could handle a variety of inputs.

----------

**Reflection:**  
The biggest challenge I faced was correctly calculating and appending profits to the rows and then writing the modified data to the output file while maintaining the integrity of the original data. Debugging errors like handling invalid rows or missing data also required careful attention to detail. Through iterative testing and development, I was able to resolve these issues. 

Another challenge was ensuring the program properly tracked and displayed the movies with the highest and lowest profits. It took some trial and error to ensure the logic for updating these values worked as expected.

Overall, I feel that I achieved the objectives of this project. It was a valuable learning experience, especially in terms of working with lists of lists and file operations. I enjoyed the problem-solving process during this project. The structured approach of planning, coding, and testing made the process manageable and helped me overcome challenges effectively.
